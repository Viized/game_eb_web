          This essay uniquely connects various scholars and materials I have
          researched, including Bergson’s “Matter and Time,” Benjamin’s
          insights, Heidegger’s concepts of “thing” and “thingness,” Daniel
          Miller’s discussions on materials, materiality, and material culture,
          and Bachelard’s “A Poetics of Space,” among others. It also delves
          into concepts such as mnemonic, involuntary memory, and archivization.
          In relation to my vision for game structure, the essay analyzes how
          materials, particularly textiles, can generate and preserve memories
          through traces. These elements may enable memory stimulation and
          sensory re-experiences that vary from person to person, transcending
          spatial boundaries and the constraints of time. Additionally, it
          explores how they assist in reconstructing and recollecting memories,
          albeit with the unavoidable risks and products of mixing and
          creating—often accompanied by the haunting presence of the present,
          whether we consciously acknowledge it or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the abstract and introduction, Hunt begins by addressing our common
          misunderstanding of how we typically frame materials, viewing them
          solely as portals for meanings greater than themselves. This
          perspective neglects the fact that materials are actively involved in
          the sense-making process and possess their own “thingness,” even when
          serving as tools for artistic expression (Howes and Attfield).
          “…material culture offers an understanding of how people make sense of
          the world through physical objects.” The discussion then shifts to
          exploring how one could generate more from already existing memories,
          drawing on Woolf’s writings related to seemingly unreasonable and
          questionable aspects of involuntary memory from the past. I wasn’t
          fully aware of how deeply I manipulate my past and dreams until I
          began documenting them due to my current work and journals. (Bal) “…as
          an activity occurring in the present, in which the past is
          continuously modified and redescribed.” I used to hold a very negative
          and passive view of this, but since engaging with tertiary retention
          and Stiegler, I am now more convinced that, particularly in the
          digital age, we may have the opportunity to leverage this process if
          we continually reflect on the instability of our memories and actively
          forge new connections between them. (Stiegler, resisting the loss of
          individuality.) We should stop accepting external and passive systems
          of categorization, such as core aesthetics. As Susan Stewart discusses
          in “On Longing,” the concept of “Micrographia” also plays a
          significant role in this exploration.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Section B, “Application,” the discussion begins with Derrida’s
          concept of archivization and archive fever, explaining how
          archivization involves “consigning, inscribing a trace in some
          external location, a space outside.” This concept resonates with the
          different stages of memory as outlined by Stiegler, particularly the
          essence of tertiary retention, which focuses on the what, how, and why
          of externalizing memories. Part of my decision to choose the website
          and users’ journals as a creation format stems from my interest in how
          craft can serve not only as a medium for archiving but also as the
          archive itself. This includes various forms such as drawings,
          wearables, sounds, and fake documentary or video clips.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the section titled ‘B2. Themes of the Gigantic,’ I primarily focus
          on the discussion of clothing’s capability to represent not only the
          signs and history of wear but also to serve as evidence of the past
          and proof of people’s existence. More importantly, clothes can become
          a site of meaning. In the second set of the game, I plan to include a
          semi-open closet that holds all of my father’s clothes, where I will
          express my feelings about the gradually faded scent of him lingering
          in the attic room environment. My craft work aims to serve as places
          for reliving and reflecting on experiences rather than merely
          representing them. This raises intriguing questions about the
          narrative and text lines within the game. Additionally, the act of
          making becomes a means to be ‘rediscovered and remembered rather than
          forgotten.’ I envision this section featuring a pixelated, blurry art
          style to enhance this theme.
        </p>

        <p>
          In B3, “Themes of the ‘Miniature,’” I explore aspects that validate my
          intention behind creating portable physical works and my desire for
          the entire display space to be a smaller, more intimate room. This
          idea is informed by Bachelard’s notion of the home as an ‘archive,’
          suggesting that for these works to be accessible, they must be
          small—not only to represent intimacy through a visually pleasing size.
          Benjamin’s concept that “the homely is at the same time ‘unheimlich’”
          further supports this setting, as it aligns with my aim to mimic the
          plot of The Room, beginning each set and scene with the act of waking
          up in bed. Rooms filled with everyday objects serve as stages that
          allow for plots and intense performances to unfold.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the conclusion, Hunt once again emphasizes the significance of
          textiles as a unique material, highlighting how they inherently differ
          from others. This prompts me to consider the realm of digital media:
          if I regard digital game-making as a form of crafting, how does this
          perspective change? What happens to the uniqueness of each physical
          material when translated into the digital space? Are digital
          representations merely visual re-presentations of actual materials, or
          do they exist independently in their own right? When we indicate
          different materials visually by altering settings in shaders or
          procedural nodes, are they fundamentally different, or do they retain
          the essence of their physical counterparts?

          This article explores the concept of coziness and its manifestation in
          gameplay. By integrating elements of walking simulators and cozy
          gameplay experiences into my project, I gain a deeper understanding of
          what coziness truly entails. This understanding will ultimately
          enhance my analysis of Animal Crossing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before reading, I typically assumed that cozy games needed to be
          associated with specific themes and/or interactive in-game items,
          viewing coziness more as an aesthetic or artistic visual expression.
          However, this mindset positions audiences and players as passive
          acceptors of the games and their narratives, contrasting with the
          player-text approach. Games should not be limited to merely accepting
          information, following preconceived notions, and reacting to designed
          rules.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to the article, cozy games are distinct from “casual
          playing.” Instead of being defined as a genre, “cozy” is better
          understood as a gaming experience shaped by individuals’ perceptions,
          influenced by their unique historical contexts and the relationships
          players build with cozy games. Therefore, it is crucial to remember
          that the perception of coziness is inevitably subjective.
        </p>

        <p>
          To better define cozy, the article first explores the connections
          between cozy, home, and the feeling of home as “a place to live and
          feel secure” (4). It then argues that coziness should be acknowledged
          as comprising “structural components” (4), fulfilled by three main
          aspects: safety, abundance, and softness.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am particularly interested in the idea of cozy games functioning as
          a form of self-care, mentioned at the bottom of page six. I believe
          part of my initial hesitation to create a narrative-based,
          story-driven game stems from my desire to provide experiences and
          interactive scenes rather than a game with a clear and linear
          storyline. I am considering adding a scene where players can drag
          objects from the previous three environments to create their own new
          scene or choose one from the three to decorate with objects across
          different scenes as they wish. I am curious to see how people from
          various cultural backgrounds would interpret these spaces through
          their interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The articles then delve deeper into the origins of coziness through
          three sections: game aesthetics and mechanics, coziness in non-cozy
          games, and the home space and communities. The second part is
          particularly inspiring for me as it offers insights on how to
          conceptually structure the game-playing flow and artistically arrange
          spaces and elements for various rooms, centred around the ideas of
          ‘predictability’ and ‘familiarity/reliability.’
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, the notion of games serving as a second home and as “an
          open possibility space” for experiencing and experimenting with
          “imaginative engagement” is something I am eager to explore further. I
          aim to draw examples from various genres, specifically horror games,
          as I have personally observed how often coziness overlaps with them.

          Games”)

          In Chapter 2, “Circle: It all starts at home,” Taylor analyzes how
          players set up games and their related hardware in domestic spaces.
          The chapter discusses the historical advertising of equipment targeted
          towards males and the hidden messages that shape gaming experiences
          based on men’s needs. It begins by referencing the history of game
          setups as practices of masculinity in creating domestic spaces. While
          consoles like the Wii are marketed as family-friendly (similar to the
          Switch), in practice, they often fail to encourage family play, as
          I’ve experienced personally. The chapter then examines collective data
          from NeoGAF forum discussions, categorizing home gaming setups into
          three general types: Hearth, Bunker, and Cabinet. I am particularly
          interested in the Cabinet type, as the book suggests these setups
          reflect our relationships with our surroundings and family members.
          This might also explain my fascination with wunderkammer or cabinets
          of curiosity, as they aesthetically enhance the arrangement of “gears”
          in our environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my living room from Scene 3, I find that my space is usually
          semi-open, allowing me to feel both isolated and connected at the same
          time. Initially, I wouldn’t have considered it a setting for escaping
          reality, but reflecting on the book’s insights, I see how I modified
          the attic rooms for that purpose. Ultimately, I had to return to the
          living room because I still wanted to maintain some communication with
          my mother while playing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Compared to the closet setup in my home during primary school, which
          is depicted in the bottom left corner beside the balcony in the top
          left room of Set 3, the setup created by my father for family use was
          more of a bunker type (as discussed on page 94, in “Bunkers versus
          Feminism”). In that space, I repeatedly played the initial plots of
          games like “Silent Hill: The Room,” “House of the Dead 2,” “Return to
          Castle Wolfenstein,” and various online casual games. I also find it
          interesting to compare this setup with my cousin’s gaming gear in his
          living room during the same period.

      <div class="description-box">
        <p>
          Flanagan’s Playing House chapter examines how domestic play has long
          been used to rework cultural paradigms, especially through
          experimenting with artificial identities, self-expressive
          environments, and humorous scenarios (17). She emphasizes that
          “childhood itself is a cultural invention” (25), and that toys like
          dollhouses acted as a “faithful mirror of what happened in real
          homes,” revealing how play and daily life have been intertwined for
          more than a century (30).
        </p>

        <p>
          What stands out to me is her framing of play as a form of “rewriting”
          (33), where domestic roles and narratives are not simply repeated but
          reimagined. This directly connects to my own work, since I am not only
          archiving but also reshaping memories and spaces through crafted
          environments. Flanagan’s references, such as Rosler’s Semiotics of the
          Kitchen (48), show how even everyday domestic labor can be transformed
          into a performative critique, which resonates with my blending of
          memory work and digital staging.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, her attention to “domestic places being represented in
          digital games” (49) gives me a strong anchor: the home is both a
          literal space of play and a symbolic one. It pushes me to think of my
          game sets—closets, attics, living rooms—not only as reconstructed
          environments, but as playful, critical sites where cultural roles and
          personal memory collide.

      <div class="description-box">
        <p>
          Flanagan’s essay Reskinning the Everyday calls attention to how we
          engage with interfaces in ways that are often invisible to us. She
          observes that “while designers and engineers work to erase mechanical
          portals between users and machines, and science fiction writers
          fantasize about direct mental connections to computing systems, it
          seems the opportune moment to shift ourselves away from our perception
          of current, everyday computing experiences” (305). This resonates with
          my own reflection on how easily I naturalize daily interactions with
          screens and inputs, rarely questioning their cultural or political
          weight.
        </p>

        <p>
          She admits, “in the daily quest to transfer ideas from head to
          document, I often take these interfaces for granted” (307), and here
          I’m reminded of Thomas Kuhn’s work on paradigms: just as scientific
          frameworks structure what can be thought, the metaphors embedded in
          our technologies constrain how we imagine and act. Flanagan points out
          the irony that “Internet browsers rarely show users how data gets from
          point A to point B, as though the structure of the system has nothing
          to do with its content” (312). This makes me think about my own game
          environments as not just containers but structured, biased systems
          shaping meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
          By “mapping ubiquity,” she argues that “the blurring of space,
          location, and time leaves no sense of near or far, past or present,”
          while reminding us that “metaphors in programming have a strong affect
          on how digital tools are made and used” (315). This deeply connects to
          my exploration of tertiary retention: the way metaphors,
          architectures, and even invisible protocols inform what kinds of
          memories can be externalized, stored, and replayed. For me, the essay
          encourages a more critical practice—treating both material craft and
          digital craft not just as surfaces, but as systems of mediation and
          rewriting.

          graphics and game design, transforms identity into an aestheticized
          construct. The argument begins with how modeling reduces bodies into
          vertices, edges, and polygons — an abstraction that is not only
          technical but also cultural. This abstraction encodes ideas of
          efficiency, smoothness, and “recognizable” identity, which in turn
          shape how digital bodies are produced and perceived.

          Kerich emphasizes that modeling is never neutral. The very structure
          of polygons frames identity as modular, editable, and reproducible. In
          this way, modeling echoes what Thomas Kuhn describes about paradigms:
          once a system of representation is in place, it not only organizes
          practice but also limits what can be imagined within it. The
          “aestheticization” emerges from this process — identity is no longer
          lived, but represented as a visual surface, optimized and rationalized
          for legibility.

          At the same time, Kerich points to the contradictions in this system.
          The push toward realism in polygonal graphics often conceals the
          instability of identity, reducing it to stylized tropes or
          standardized bodies. Yet the very tools of modeling can also be sites
          of resistance: by exposing the “constructedness” of polygons, artists
          and players might destabilize these conventions and open possibilities
          for critical play.

          For me, this resonates with Benjamin’s notion of reproducibility and
          Stiegler’s tertiary retention. Polygonal modeling externalizes
          identity much like recording externalizes memory — turning the self
          into manipulable data. It also connects back to my own project: when I
          craft avatars or environments, I am working within a system that both
          enables expression and enforces constraints, asking whether identities
          in digital spaces are ultimately fluid or flattened into aesthetic
          codes.
