          This is by far the most and the only essay that connects most of the
          scholars and materials I searched on, including: Matter and Time from
          Bergson, Benjamin, the concept of "thing" and "thingness" from
          Heidegger, materials/ materiality/ material culture from Daniel
          Miller, A Poetics of Space from Bachelard, and many. Concepts such as
          mnemonic, involuntary memory, and archivization are also discussed.
          Responding to the way I want the game to be structured, it also
          analyzes how materials, in this case textiles, can not only help to
          generate memories and keep through traces, which may enable memory
          stimulation and sensory reexperiences differing from individual to
          individual across the boudaries of space and the limitation of time,
          but also assist in reconstructing and recollecting with the
          unavoidable risk/products of mixing and creating with the haunting of
          the present, whether we want or even realize them or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the abstract and introduction, Hunt starts with our common
          misunderstanding of how we normally frame materials, working purely as
          portals for meanings greater than and beyond them, while neglecting
          the fact that materials themselves are actively involved in the
          sensemaking process, and their "thingness" even when working as tools
          for artistic expression. (Howes and Attfield) "...material culture
          offers an understanding of how people make sense of the world through
          physical objects."Then it goes on talking about why and how one could
          generate more based on already existing memories, using Woolf's
          writings related to seemingly unreasonable and questionable details of
          the involuntary memory of the past. I wasn't quite realizing how
          deeply I manipulate my past and dreams until I started to document
          them because of my current work and journals. (Bal) "...as an activity
          occurring in the present, in which the past is continuously modified
          and redescribed." I used to held a very negative and passive feeling
          about this, but since tertiary retention and Stiegler, right now, I am
          more convinced that (especially during the age of digital), we might
          win a chance to take advantage of this if we constantly reflect on the
          instability through self-driven recollecting of the memory and
          actively making new connections between stuffs. (Stiegler, resist
          against the lose of individuality) (Stop accepting external and
          passive systems of categorization like core aesthetics.) Susan
          Stewart: On Longing, "Micrographia".
        </p>

        <p>
          In section B Application, starting with Derrida's archivization and
          archive fever, it explains how archivization is "consigning,
          inscribing a trace in some external location, a space outside." The
          concept reminds me of the different stages of memory from Stiegler,
          and the essence of tertiary retention, which is what/how/why to
          externalize memories. Part of my decision to choose the website and
          users' own journals as a format of creation is also related to my
          interest in how craft can not only be the medium of archive but the
          archive itself. (it's drawing, wearables, sounds, fake
          documentary/video clips...)
        </p>

        <p>
          B2. Themes of the 'Gigantic', I mainly focus on the discussion of the
          capability of clothes to represent not only the signs and history of
          wearing, standing as evidence of the past and the proof of people's
          existence, but more importantly, they can become a site. In the second
          set of the game, as I plan to put the semi-open closet that holds all
          of my father's clothes and talk about my feelings on the gradually
          faded smell of him on his clothes in the whole attic room environment,
          my craft work as places for reliving and reflecting rather than just
          representing the experiences. (wonders about the narrative and text
          lines in the game) Meanwhile, making is a way to "rediscovered and
          remembered rather than forgotten." (pixelated/ blurry art style at
          this section)
        </p>

        <p>
          B3. Themes of the 'Miniature' sort of validate parts of my intention,
          why I need my physical work to be portable, and why I want the whole
          display space in the future to be a smaller, more intimate room.
          (Bachelard, "the home as an 'archive', and for them to be accessible,
          they have to be small, not only for the purpose of representing
          intimacy through visually pleasing size.) Benjamin, "the homely is at
          the same time 'unheimlich'"... backing the setting of mimicking the
          plot of The Room, using waking up on bed as the starts of each sets
          and scenes. Rooms filled with everyday objects and stuff are also
          stages that allow plots and intense performances to happen...
        </p>

        <p>
          In the conclusion, Hunt once again addresses the importance of
          textiles working as THE material, and how they differ from others by
          nature. How about digital, if I also regard digital game-making as a
          way of crafting? Thinking more about the uniqueness of each physical
          material and how that may shift if it happens in digital? Are the
          digital merely the visual re-presentation of the actual materials, or
          do they exist by themselves? To indicate different materials visually
          by changing the setting in the shader or procedural nodes, are they
          different or the same?

          This article discusses the concept of coziness and how coziness has
          been manifested in game playing. By incorporating elements of walking
          simulators and cozy gameplay experiences into my project, I gain a
          deeper understanding of what coziness entails, which will ultimately
          enhance my analysis of Animal Crossing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before reading, I normally presume that cozy games need to be
          associated with certain portrayed themes and/or interactive in-game
          items, and cozy leans more towards an aesthetic or artistic visual
          expression. However, this mindset pre-sets the audiences and players
          as passive acceptors of the games and their narrative, in contrast to
          the player-text approach. Games should not only be limited to and
          understood as the process of accepting information, following
          presumptions, and reacting to designed rules.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to the article, cozy games are not "casual playing", and
          rather than understanding it as a genre itself, "cozy" is more
          described as a gaming experience that often involves individuals'
          perceptions based on their living historical differences and ways that
          players build up between cozy games and themselves; therefore it is
          crucial to keep in mind that the perception of coziness is always
          unavoidablly subjective. To better define cozy, the article firstly
          mentions the connections between cozy, home and the feeling of home
          "as a place to live and feel secure" (4). Then it argues about how
          coziness needs to be acknowledged as "structural components" (4) with
          three main aspects being fulfilled: safety, abundance and softness.
          I'm also very interested in the aspect of cozy games working as a way
          of self-care, mentioned at the bottom of page six. I assume that part
          of my reason why I originally did not intend to do a narrative-based
          story-driven game is that I would rather provide experiences and a
          playable scene to interact with, instead of a game that has a clear
          and linear storyline. (I am thinking of adding a scene where players
          can drag objects in the previous three and create their own new scene,
          or choose one from the three to decorate with objects across scenes in
          the way they want, and I am curious about how people from different
          cultural backgrounds would understand these spaces through
          interactions.)
        </p>

        <p>
          What comes next in the articles is to analyze deeper about where and
          how the coziness comes from through three sections: game aesthetics
          and mechanics, coziness in non-cozy games, the home space and
          communities. The second part is more inspiring for me on how to
          conceptually structure the game-playing flow and artistically arrange
          spaces and elements for various rooms along the idea of
          'predictability' and 'familiarity/reliability'. Meanwhile, games as a
          second home and "an open possibility space" for experiencing and
          experimenting with "imaginative engagement" is also something I'm
          curious to explore more about, drawing examples across different
          genres, specifically horrors, considering personally how frequently I
          found coziness overlaps with them. (Waszkiewicz, Soft Horrors: The
          visual and ludic safety of dark cozy games)

          In chapter 2, Circle: It all starts at home, Taylor analyzes what and
          how players set up games and their related hardware in the domestic
          spaces. From the history of how equipment were advertised and markets
          straight towards males, and the hidden messages of designing
          experiences based on the needs of men, the chapter begins by referring
          back to the history of gameset as practices of masculinity in domestic
          place making. Even with examples like Wii, which is targeted at
          family-friendly consoles (similar to Switch right now, in actual daily
          use, it is hard for consoles to actually encourage playing as a family
          unit, taking myself as an example). Then the chapter goes to the
          collective data based on the images of the game setup at home, based
          on discussion from forums on NeoGAF posts, and starts to categorize
          the setup of different levels of immersive gaming experiences into
          three types in general: Hearth, Bunker, and Cabinet. In my case, I am
          interested in the cabinet the most, as the book suggests, they are
          reflections of ourselves and our relationship with the surroundings
          and other family members as well (also may explain why I fancy the
          wunderkammer/the cabinets of curiosity so much in the first place, and
          the aesthethics simply brought by making the arragement of the "gears"
          in the environment).

        <p>
          In the living room from my scene 3, I find that my living space is
          usually semi-open, fulfilling my need to stay isolated and somehow
          open simultaneously. I would not consider them as setting stages for
          reality escape initially, without pointing out by the book, and
          looking back right now, it is also interesting to see how I modified
          the attic rooms, then had to move back to the living room because I
          still expected some communications with my mother while playing.

          Compared to the closet, my home home during primary school, shown as
          down left corner beside the balcony in the room on the top left in set
          3, the setup made by my father and used by the family was more
          bunker-type, (re-read 94, Bunkers versus Feminism), where I played the
          begining plots repeatedly of games like Silent Hill: The Room, House
          of the Dead 2?, Return to the Castle Wolfenstein, and many online
          easy-playing games. (Compare the setup with my cousin's gear setup in
          his living room around the same period)
