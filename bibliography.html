          This is by far the most and the only essay that connects most of the
          scholars and materials I searched on, including: Matter and Time from
          Bergson, Benjamin, the concept of "thing" and "thingness" from
          Heidegger, materials/ materiality/ material culture from Daniel
          Miller, A Poetics of Space from Bachelard, and many. Concepts such as
          mnemonic, involuntary memory, and archivization are also discussed.
          Responding to the way I want the game to be structured, it also
          analyzes how materials, in this case textiles, can not only help to
          generate memories and keep through traces, which may enable memory
          stimulation and sensory reexperiences differing from individual to
          individual across the boudaries of space and the limitation of time,
          but also assist in reconstructing and recollecting with the
          unavoidable risk/products of mixing and creating with the haunting of
          the present, whether we want or even realize them or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the abstract and introduction, Hunt starts with our common
          misunderstanding of how we normally frame materials, working purely as
          portals for meanings greater than and beyond them, while neglecting
          the fact that materials themselves are actively involved in the
          sensemaking process, and their "thingness" even when working as tools
          for artistic expression. (Howes and Attfield) "...material culture
          offers an understanding of how people make sense of the world through
          physical objects."Then it goes on talking about why and how one could
          generate more based on already existing memories, using Woolf's
          writings related to seemingly unreasonable and questionable details of
          the involuntary memory of the past. I wasn't quite realizing how
          deeply I manipulate my past and dreams until I started to document
          them because of my current work and journals. (Bal) "...as an activity
          occurring in the present, in which the past is continuously modified
          and redescribed." I used to held a very negative and passive feeling
          about this, but since tertiary retention and Stiegler, right now, I am
          more convinced that (especially during the age of digital), we might
          win a chance to take advantage of this if we constantly reflect on the
          instability through self-driven recollecting of the memory and
          actively making new connections between stuffs. (Stiegler, resist
          against the lose of individuality) (Stop accepting external and
          passive systems of categorization like core aesthetics.) Susan
          Stewart: On Longing, "Micrographia".
        </p>

        <p>
          In section B Application, starting with Derrida's archivization and
          archive fever, it explains how archivization is "consigning,
          inscribing a trace in some external location, a space outside." The
          concept reminds me of the different stages of memory from Stiegler,
          and the essence of tertiary retention, which is what/how/why to
          externalize memories. Part of my decision to choose the website and
          users' own journals as a format of creation is also related to my
          interest in how craft can not only be the medium of archive but the
          archive itself. (it's drawing, wearables, sounds, fake
          documentary/video clips...)
        </p>

        <p>
          B2. Themes of the 'Gigantic', I mainly focus on the discussion of the
          capability of clothes to represent not only the signs and history of
          wearing, standing as evidence of the past and the proof of people's
          existence, but more importantly, they can become a site. In the second
          set of the game, as I plan to put the semi-open closet that holds all
          of my father's clothes and talk about my feelings on the gradually
          faded smell of him on his clothes in the whole attic room environment,
          my craft work as places for reliving and reflecting rather than just
          representing the experiences. (wonders about the narrative and text
          lines in the game) Meanwhile, making is a way to "rediscovered and
          remembered rather than forgotten." (pixelated/ blurry art style at
          this section)
        </p>

        <p>
          B3. Themes of the 'Miniature' sort of validate parts of my intention,
          why I need my physical work to be portable, and why I want the whole
          display space in the future to be a smaller, more intimate room.
          (Bachelard, "the home as an 'archive', and for them to be accessible,
          they have to be small, not only for the purpose of representing
          intimacy through visually pleasing size.) Benjamin, "the homely is at
          the same time 'unheimlich'"... backing the setting of mimicking the
          plot of The Room, using waking up on bed as the starts of each sets
          and scenes. Rooms filled with everyday objects and stuff are also
          stages that allow plots and intense performances to happen...
        </p>

        <p>
          In the conclusion, Hunt once again addresses the importance of
          textiles working as THE material, and how they differ from others by
          nature. How about digital, if I also regard digital game-making as a
          way of crafting? Thinking more about the uniqueness of each physical
          material and how that may shift if it happens in digital? Are the
          digital merely the visual re-presentation of the actual materials, or
          do they exist by themselves? To indicate different materials visually
          by changing the setting in the shader or procedural nodes, are they
          different or the same?
